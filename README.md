# codeLouisvilleProject2019
My Code Louisville Frontend Project for Summer 2019

For my project I created a basic portfolio site for myself showing off my some of my artistic talents.  There are no special requirements for my site.  

For my Javascript Elements I used spy scroll

For my CSS elements I used JumboHeaderImg inside my Jumbotron element.  I also used card border elements to remove borders from Bootstrap elements.  I also used card-body padding to correct alignment issues with bootstrap elements.

Please contact me if there are any questions or comments.
